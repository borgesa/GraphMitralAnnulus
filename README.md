# GraphMitralAnnulus
Code repository for "Introducing Anatomical Constraints in Mitral Annulus Segmentation in Transesophageal Echocardiography".

This repository will contain the implementation of our method that combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mitral annulus segmentation.

## Placeholder
This repository will host the code for the model presented in our paper for ASMUS 2024. The implementation will be made available closer to the conference date.
